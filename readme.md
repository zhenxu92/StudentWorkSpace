This project is a simplified version of excel.

You can use commands like you are interacting with console to manipulate the sheet

Cell is the basic interface of the cells in the sheet

Spreadsheet is the core manager for all the functions

TextExcel is the main loop

spreadsheetlocation is a class to describe the location

commands:

clear - clear everything in the sheet and print it out

clear A1 - clear A1 cell

A1 = "hello" - assign "hello" to A1 cell

A1 - inspect A1 cell

.

Bug for now:

cannot use fullTextCell() method in spreadsheet.java
